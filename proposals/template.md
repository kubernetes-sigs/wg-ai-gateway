# <Proposal Name>

* Authors: <Add Authors Here>
* Collaborators: <Add Supporters, Reviewers, etc here. These are individuals
  that are participators and/or stakeholders, though they may not be directly
  authoring content.>

# What?

> Add a brief, and succinct summary describing what we want to accomplish at a
> high level.

# Why?

> Explain the general motivation for doing this. The purpose here is to build
> consensus, and get agreement that this needs to be solved.

## User Stories

> Provide several short, simple descriptions of the requirement from the
> perspectives of users. Consider all the different kinds of users there may be,
> and incorporate stories for each of them.
>
> E.g.
>
>  - "As a _developer_ I want `$GOAL` so that `$BENEFIT`"
>  - "As a _cluster administrator_ I want `$GOAL` so that `$BENEFIT`"

## Goals

> As an extension of the motivation, enumerate specific goals.

## Non-Goals

> Explain which things are not goals, and not intended to be accomplished by
> this proposal.

# How?

> **This should be left blank until the "What?" and "Why?" are agreed upon,
> as defining "How?" the goals are accomplished is not important unless we can
> first even agree on what the problem is, and why we want to solve it.
>
> This section is fairly freeform, because (again) these proposals will
> eventually find there way into any number of different final proposal formats
> in other projects. However, the general guidance is to break things down into
> highly focused sections as much as possible to help make things easier to
> read and review. Long, unbroken walls of code and YAML in this document are
> not advisable as that may increase the time it takes to review.

# Relevant Links

> Add any relevant links to any relevant or prior art here.
