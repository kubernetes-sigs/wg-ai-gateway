Proposals and discussions for the [AI Gateway Working Group].

[AI Gateway Working Group]:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-ai-gateway

## About

For more general information about the working group, please see:

* Our [README] - This provides an overview of the community, contact and
  communication information.
* Our [Charter] - This describes what this WG intends to accomplish in
  detail, our general goals and areas of interest.

As a Kubernetes working group, we do not _directly_ own projects or code,
our purpose is to make proposals. As such, this repository is meant for
discussions and staging proposals which (generally) will be developed into
proposals for specific Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and their
sub-projects.
