# AI Gateway Working Group

Proposals and discussions for the [AI Gateway Working Group].

[AI Gateway Working Group]:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-ai-gateway

## About

For more general information about the working group, please see:

* Our [README] - This provides an overview of the community, contact and
  communication information.
* Our [Charter] - This describes what this WG intends to accomplish in
  detail, our general goals and areas of interest.

As a Kubernetes working group, we do not _directly_ own projects or code,
our purpose is to make proposals. As such, this repository is meant for
discussions and staging proposals which (generally) will be developed into
proposals for specific Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and their
sub-projects.

[Charter]:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-ai-gateway/charter.md

### Proposals

Please see our [proposals directory](/proposals) to view the proposals we
have so far. If you'd like to submit a new proposal, please contact us in one of 
our communication channels to get some feedback and identify potential 
supporters for your proposal in the community who can help move it forward with you.

### Prototypes

You can create prototypes for any of our proposals, however to avoid confusion
keep these in a separate branch and don't merge to `main`. This allows us to
collaborate and share, without creating any confusion of there being code in
`main` and that somehow being construed as something that should be used in other
projects.

## Community, discussion, contribution, and support
